## About jQuery

[jQuery](http://jquery.com/) is a utility library for easy DOM access & manipulation, event handling, Ajax and more. By using jQuery you can write consise and expressive code which works across modern and legacy browsers. jQuery has extensive tests, detailed documentation, a large active community and an ecosystem of plugins.

## Use [.on()](http://api.jquery.com/on/) for event binding

Methods like [`.click()`](http://api.jquery.com/click/) or [`.change()`](http://api.jquery.com/change/) are just alias for `.on('click')` and `.on('change')`. 

### Why?

* It's a way to keep consistency as all your events have the same signature.
* Avoiding using aliases let you trim the jQuery custom build. That way you reduce load/parse times and the file size.
 

### How?
``` javascript

/* avoid: .click() */
$('.todo-item').click(function(event) {});

/* recommended: .on() */
$('.todo-item').on('click', function() {});

```
