## About jQuery

[jQuery](http://jquery.com/) is a utility library for easy DOM access & manipulation, event handling, Ajax and more. By using jQuery you can write consise and expressive code which works across modern and legacy browsers. jQuery has extensive tests, detailed documentation, a large active community and an ecosystem of plugins.

## Prefer promises over callbacks
A Promise represents a proxy for a value not necessarily known when the promise is created. It allows you to associate handlers to an asynchronous action's eventual success value or failure reason.

### Why?
Use promises instead of callbacks to keep code more readable and future proof when handling asynchronous requests.
Promises can also be passed around so other modules can chain (.then) onto it, instead of complex callbacks inside callbacks (pyramid of doom) structures.

### How?
``` javascript
// bad
$.ajax('example.com/articles/1/author', {
  success: function(response) {},
  error: function(err) {}
});

// good
var request = $.ajax('example.com/articles/1/author');
request.then(function(response) {});
request.catch(function(err) {});

// ES6
request.catch((err) => {});
```
