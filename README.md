## About jQuery

[jQuery](http://jquery.com/) is a utility library for easy DOM access & manipulation, event handling, Ajax and more. By using jQuery you can write consise and expressive code which works across modern and legacy browsers. jQuery has extensive tests, detailed documentation, a large active community and an ecosystem of plugins.

## Cache jQuery lookups

Every call to `$(element}` asks jQuery to rescan for the matching element, wrap it in a jQuery object, and create a new instance of something you already have in memory. This is something avoidable if you already did it once.

### Why?
* It avoids querying the DOM for the element everytime want to use it, which greatly improves performance.
* You can use descriptive variable names which convey more meaning.

### How?

``` javascript
/* avoid: repeating jQuery lookups */
$('button').addClass('is-active');
$('button').on('click', function(event) {});

/* recommended: cache jQuery lookup in variable */
var $button = $('button');
$button.addClass('is-active');
$button.on('click', function(event) {});
```
