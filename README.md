## About jQuery

[jQuery](http://jquery.com/) is a utility library for easy DOM access & manipulation, event handling, Ajax and more. By using jQuery you can write consise and expressive code which works across modern and legacy browsers. jQuery has extensive tests, detailed documentation, a large active community and an ecosystem of plugins.

## Avoid using the `.css()` method
### Why?
In most cases toggling a class can accomplish the same thing.
By not using the  `.css()` method this can be omitted when creating a custom jQuery build to reduce the size.

### How?
``` javascript
var $myElement = $('[my-element]');

// Bad
$myElement.css('border', '1px solid green');

// Good
$myElement.addClass('is-active');
```
